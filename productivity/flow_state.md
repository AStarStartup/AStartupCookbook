## Flow State

### Night and Day Sessions

This concept was actually introduced to me by a musician who was teaching workshops on how to increase your creativity and productivity. Scientific evidence shows that people are most productive when they are in the flow state [Insert evidence here.]. For most people, it takes several hours to get into the flow state [insert evidence], and people usually remain in the flow state for up to _____ hours [insert evidence].

The idea behind night and day sessions is that you want to separate your creative work sessions where you are in the creative flow, from any and all technical work. The idea is pretty simple, and for anyone who has produced music, it hits really close to home, but anyone can get the concept: You’re working on a track/song in your sequencer software, and you’re killing it; the track/song sound awesome and your feeling energetic, until you come across something technical about either the software or hardware. Then you change hats and get sidetracked figuring out the technical details, completely exiting the flow state, and when you come back, the energy is dead. You don’t even have to make music to understand that one. Without fail, almost every single time, this will completely destroy your flow state.

The idea is to be in a state of mindfulness. Once if learned about this, my productivity shot up right away. My tracks not only sounded better, I was able to make them faster, and it was a lot more fun because being in the flow, you’re not focused on being tired or now you’re not the best. You’re just into it and having fun. This lesson can be applied to anything, but with writing, it can help you out immensely because writing is a creative process best done in the flow state.

Everybody’s body and mind work differently, so it’s best for you to figure out what puts you into the flow state, and what takes you out of it. For most of us, Facebook is the productivity killer. You have to be mindful about when you are the most awake, and what times of day you are most productive, and make that your day-time session. Some people are nocturnal, so a day-time session might be a night-time session and vice versa,

### Flow State Optimization

It’s important if you care about getting work done, to keep yourself in the flow state as long as possible. This involves separating your work sessions into night and day sessions, and not getting sidetracked by technical details. This is also where your critical thinking skills come in handy.

Every good technical document needs good supporting information. It is important as an author to be able to separate fact from fiction. The definition of a fact, contrary to popular belief is something that can be proven true, as opposed to a law or truth, which is something that is true. Many things are taken as facts that aren’t really true.

When writing, you want to make notes of things that are facts and earmark them for review, and further elaboration later. If you stop writing each time you want to cite evidence, it’s going to take you million years to write the book, and you’ll lose your train of thought. Instead, you want to continue writing in the flow state as long as possible. It can also be useful to use headings to store temporary to-do lists. By using a higher order heading, such as H4 or H5, you can give yourself a reminder in your navigation pane of important facts to address. By combining a macro header to remind you, and also inserting markers in your paragraph of the exact items that need to be addressed later, you can continue moving on and getting real progress done. The most important thing is to avoid switching time between different tasks at all costs. When you aren't feeling creative, scroll through your navigation page till you see something you can knock out.

### Bulleted Lists

Almost every good research paper or technical manual starts off as a bulleted list. A bulleted list is a tool that allows you get a 10,000-foot level.

#### The First Iteration through the List

This point of this section is that you should go through the list, and write one sentence to one paragraph description of what that item is about.

### Taking Notes Over Your Reading

The art of technical writing can also be described as the art of turning carefully taken notes into an official document. One of the best things that you can do is take good notes over your resource materials. You can’t just expect to read the material, do some homework, cram for an exam, and get a passing grade. Technical writing requires attention to detail and the best way to do that is through documenting your notes correctly. Not taking a little bit of extra effort into taking better notes help.
