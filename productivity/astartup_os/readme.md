### [Astartup OS](./)

The Astartup OS, or Astartup Method, is based on the physics principle that resistance times distance or time, that work is a cost to accomplish goals, and that in order to maximize productivity and happiness you must minimize costs by minimizing resistance and maximize reward through maximizing health, both physical and mental. This then allows us to use some AI algoirhms to help us out, but we want to not need the algoirhms and instead work in our logs using Morning, Night, and Day Sessions and Session tickets in an Issue Tracking System (ITS). In order to keep the number of paper logbooks down, we use a 3-log system detailed in the Logs section. These logs fascilitate the Hour of Seconds, which is an hour dedicated to your Seconary thread two times per day,along with the [Pomodoro technique](../pomodoro_technique) covered in the previous section.
