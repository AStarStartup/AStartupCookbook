#### Single, Secondary, and Self Threads and Logs

The Astartup OS uses three logs to minimize the number of bulky logbooks required to do our job. You want to start out each day by starting your Self Log, which you use to do self-care and record things like todo lists, drawings, and ideas unrelated to work.
