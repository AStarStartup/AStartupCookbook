#### OS Concepts

This section briefly overviews some useful knoweledge about how computer operating systems work that apply to inventing and entrepreneurship.

The definition of an Operating System is the system in which a thing operates. This chapter is about how the system that Startups Operate and how top optimize it using proven computer science. In many ways a startup is like a piece of computer software, and if it isn't then that is a like a bug in what should operate like software.

##### Objects

Each object is, in essence, a patent. These can be only one patent.
Inventions are a lot like computer programming, and in fact, most inventions can be programmed into the computer in some sort of way. It can either be represented in computer form or exist entirely inside of it.

##### System Components

Each department is an isolated system component that is both synchronous and asynchronous. The inner workings of the engineering department, say for instance the engineering departments are of little concern to the marketing department for the majority of the time. Instructions and rules go in, products come out.

###### Schedulers

One extremely valuable takeaway from computer science that is extremely applicable to business, is the basics of how a computer operating system works. This book is by no means about computer operating systems, but it is important to know many of these concepts while running a business because your business is in many ways, an operating system. A business by its very nature has a system that it operates by.
