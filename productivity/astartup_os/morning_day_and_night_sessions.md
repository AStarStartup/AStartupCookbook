#### Morning, Day, and Night Sessions

Morning, Day, and Night Sessions is a powerful productivity technique to maximize flow state time by reducing resistance and working with your temporal focus and be energetic. The longer you work, the more stressed out you'll get, going to and beyond the breaking point at times causing your brain to start shutting off and preventing you from going into the flow state. Some people are awake or work in the flow state at night, others in the morning, so if this is you then your day session is at night but will still be called a Day session, and vice versa for the Night session.

##### Morning Session

The Hour of Seconds (HoSe) is an hour of low-resistance and high-productivity work on your Secondary project and another HoSe for your Night session. You want to make the neurons that fire together wire together and not overfit training data, which is AI-jargon for you get confused by when you beat against the wall for too long. We want to start out with a review of the prior work session. If the last work session was on a different project, you'll need to review the documentation for the last time you worked on that project. For an example of this you'll want to see the Cooking with Cale livestream on YouTube and at <cookingwithcale.org>.

After doing the review you start off by stating something like "Yesterday I did...", then follow it up with "Today I'm going to...".

After you have created a todo list, you want to create Issue tickets on GitHub for the issues your going to do, then open your secondary log and create a new log entry using the issue ticket number as follows:

```IMUL
>Todo.Insert example Morning Log.
```

Once your logs are prepped and ready to go, you then open up a timer start a Countdown timer for one hour and another for 25 minutes. Once the 25 minute timer runs you, if you haven't completed the issue (which is perfectly fine), just the timer. You want to get two to threes issues done, but it's okay if don't get it done, it's like dieting, you want to try to change your habits over a long period of time. The important part is to learn how to break up large issues into more digestible work chunks. Again, you are your worst enemy here so you have to train yourself to just jump through the two to three issues as fast as possible so you can keep the ball moving.

##### Day Session

The Day Session starts out exactly like the Morning Session only your Primary project you'll work on all day. After the first hour goes by, you just want to use the Pomodoro technique for the rest of the day. The goal is once you get used to the Hour of Seconds it will condition your brain to enter the flow state after the first hour. More information about psychological techniques you can use to build good habits can be found in the [Psychology chapter](../psychology).

```IMUL
>Todo.Insert example Day Log.
```

##### Night Session

The night session is identical to the Morning session, but you do it on the Primary project that worked on during the day. During this time you want to get reduce the resistance in the project by tackling the issue backlog and doing fun stuff. Unlike the Day session where you free to do whatever you want all day, the Night session you need to cap the time at an Hour of Seconds because it will train your brain to get more work done in the hour.
