## Broken Windows

Broken windows may be a failed policing strategy because not everyone is a privileged person, but it broken windows can kill a project, startup, or mature business. When you leave many uncompleted tasks in a project, it gives the sense that no one lives there. Most people can do a great job improving software, but not many people can start the process going in the right direction so when you are founding, it is critical to minimize the public-facing broken window count; having a private scrapyard repository is a better choice.

The key metrics we are concerned with to maximize tasks completion rate are

## 6.4.a Finish One Issue At a Time and Schedule Others

## 6.4.b Eliminating Road Blocks

## 6.4.c Setting Reminders

## 6.4.d Setting Up a Productive Work Environment

## 6.4.e Setting Priorities
