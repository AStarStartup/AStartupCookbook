## Consolidation

It is incredibly important to use technical writing to eliminate redundancy. Technical writing is a lot like computer programming Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) Principle. It is best practice to define code once, then reference your wrapper code instead of the original code so when the original code changes it does not break your code, only your wrapper. This concept also applies to technical writing. You can define a meaning with a key, then reference the key instead of the unwrapped concept.
