# 9 Engineering

## 9.1 Case Study: Elon Musk

## 9.2 Engineering Think

This chapter is all about learning to think like an engineer. In many ways, an engineer is an inventor. The definition of an invention according to Google 2014 is “the action of inventing something, typically a process or device.” An invention is only an invention the first time it is created. After that, it is no longer new and is a product.

## 9.3 Engineer Classes

This is important because every entrepreneur needs to know what type of engineer you’re going to need to hire.

## 9.4 Prototyping

In my college days, I had the opportunity of working as a Student ambassador for my engineering school working with little kids doing activities to get young kids interested in engineering. One of the games that we played was the Marshmallow Tower.

### 9.4.a The Perfection Bug

The Marshmallow Challenge is prototyping exercise where you use spaghetti, marshmallows, tape, and string to build a tower out of marshmallows. The interesting thing about this game is that in studies when kids where pitted against skilled engineers and adults (note there is a difference), the kids usually beat the engineers. This is because the engineers would typically spend too much time trying to make things perfect and proper. This would slow them down and they would often have design blunders. The kids would experiment more and play and it often lean to superior designs. The Marshmallow Challenge is another example of Design Thinking in action.

## 9.5 Precision Engineering

Bill Gates was quoted as saying, “To be a good professional engineer, always start to study late for exams, because it teaches you how to manage time and tackle emergencies.” When I first got into engineering school, most of the smartest people in the program would always do this. I didn’t get it at all. I was busting my butt off, studying ahead of time, and when I would study with the guys a week before the test, all of them would be like, “I just opened the book yesterday, I’m not ready to study yet.” I would be the only one prepared, but somehow they got better grades on the test than I did.

But how could this be so? Were they smarter than me? After getting to the know the guys, years later I realized that I was just as smart as them, it’s just that they had a better grasp on exactly how much time it takes to learn something.
The most important lesson to take away from this is that it is extremely important when you are working in the industry, that you be able to estimate the amount of time that it is going to take you to do accomplish a task. After failing a couple of times after you’ve cut it close on a number of occasions, you start to realize exactly how much time something is going to take.

My first experience manufacturing electronics was in spring and summer of 2013. I have friends who throw music festivals, and my buddy had asked me to create a large spider web structure that had LEDs that lit up.

As I progressed further into engineering school, I tried to copy the other guys' technique of putting off everything till the last minute, with absolutely horrible results.

## 9.6 Thinking like a Team-member

Most people have the assumption that getting good grades in engineering school means that you are a better engineer than the people getting lower grades. This isn’t the case at all.. Google

## 9.6 Common Acronyms

## 9.6.a. DRY

The Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle comes from software engineering and the purpose is that when you repeat the same source code, humans will almost indefinitely introduce bugs. For this reason it is best to write code only once and use the pre-written and tested code whenever possible. This reduces the cost of development and provides a more reliable product.

## 9.6.a KISS

The Keep it short and simple (KISS) principle is a variation of Occam's razor.

## 9.6.b R4

Rapidly Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle.

## 9.7 Problem Solving

### 9.10.a Rule Identification

When playing games with people, it is important to identify the rules of the game first. : Quantify; quality:

### 9.10.b Next Step Identification

### 9.10.c Winning Condition Identification
