Startups take time and there is plenty of gloom and doom.

The hardest part is first building a product that solves enough customer need to make enough money to compete in today's market, second is self-care, third recruiting a team, fourth not be homeless, and fifth completing the product in within the market window. Many of these things are completely out of your control.
