### 5.3.a The Lean Startup Method

Every entrepreneur should probably start by not making the most common mistakes startups make; or rather this is a requirement that might be solved using the Lean Startup Method (Lean Startup). Lean Startup is a variation of Agile Development combined with customer Entrepreneurship gathered both with software and in person that allow the organization to focus on the features the customer is most interested in.

### 5.3.b Gloom and Doom

Statics don't lie, 90% of startups fail[1]. Don't proceed if you think it's going to be a walk in the park and everything will happen right away. Startups take time and there is plenty of gloom and doom. The sad truth is that women only make up 5 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs, minorities 4%, and 91% of the CEOs of major corporations are white men[2]. At the same time, this means that there is plenty of room for women and minorities in business. The hardest part is first building a product that solves enough customer need to make enough money to compete in today's market, second is self-care, third recruiting a team, fourth not be homeless, and fifth completing the product in within the market window. Many of these things are completely out of your control.
