## Mission and Vision

The mission of A-Startup is to maximize the chances of success of your startup by teaching as many people as possible modern industry best practices, time optimization techniques, and Artificial Intelligence theory, and to provide free software tools to assist you in this task.

The vision of A-Startup is to provide a free Markdown version of the book to all, regardless of ability to pay; and earn money by selling paper books and licensing the software for closed-source use, solely because paper books are awesome, and startups need money; any money generated will be used to funding Kabuki Starship technology and art.
