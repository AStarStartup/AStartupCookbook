# 1. Overview

This is a living book that contains engineering best practices to launch a startup based on an invention with a little bit of help from artificial intelligence using a piece of software called the Astartup-bot, named after the A-Star (A*) Algorithm. The book's purpose is in the hopes of helping you and your company does not make the same mistakes I made with my first startup company that was such a heartache for me and my son.

This book works in combination with other references documents throughout this book and is not meant to be a primary source of information for any of the subjects cited; you need to go to engineering school for that and the book would span several foreboding volumes. Each skill area touched upon is a full-time job in and of itself. This book is aiming to introduce you to the industry best practices from various disciplines and to use a little bit of AI theory to help optimize your scheduler to help you quickly scale your project/startup to compete in the rapidly evolving **EXTREMEMLY** competitive international market.

In a way, your entire life is a startup company, you just didn't know it. Startups usually have an 85% chance of failure, which is unacceptable to you. One way to boost your odds is to use AI, so if this interests you this is the book for you.

Each chapter in the book (will) contain(s) a case study of a inventor or entrepreneur that has a valuable lesson to learn about the subject of that chapter #WorkInProgress. Kabuki Toolkit (will then) contain(s) some open-source tools to help you optimize your schedule with that technique. Want to invent like Thomas Edison or Albert Einstein, or be as quirky as Elon Musk? Keep reading and submit your code to the Kabuki Toolkit at [https://github.com/kabuki-starship/kabuki-toolkit/](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/kabuki-toolkit/).

## 1.3. Case Study: Blue Storm Engineering

This book was born from a string of failures with my first startup company, Blue Storm Engineering. Blue Storm is the sign on the Mayan calendar that represents the epic struggle between good and evil. It was part of George Lucas's inspiration to write Star Wars. The Blue Storm is the evil empire with the support of the Storm Troopers. The Blue Storm is followed by the Yellow Sun, which is the age of enlightenment, which is when the Dark Side has been defeated.

The story starts with my going to audio engineering school when I was 19 in 2001 and being a jazz trumpet player at Lane Community College (LCC) in Eugene Oregon, home of the Oregon Ducks football team. I got into producing music and computer programming in 2003. I messed around a bit with 3D graphics and then attempted to do a failed music career. From 2004 to 2005 I developed my own Widget Toolkit in Java only to have it whipped out in a hard-drive crash because I wasn't using revision control. Years worth of code got wiped out in an instant causing me to give up on the widget toolkit.

I invented the product that I would later start a startup company based on called the Symmetry Live in 2007. It began as a paper drawing of a MIDI Controller for controlling software synthesizers and drum machines with what I call an Isymmetric Human User Interface, which is a neat design that allows you to control and split up a symmetrical MIDI controller around a LCD monitor up to control 4 devices.

There are all kinds of reasons why the Symmetry Live is a classic Case Study in what can go right and wrong in a technology invention startup. I was in love with this product. Let me tell you, it did everything. I put in the kitchen sink and kept throwing every feature I could all in one monster that was sadly unmanageable by a single person who isn't superman. This book is about how I tackled the challenge by myself without any help and a warning to readers about exactly how miserable it was for my family and I. I'm writing this book to help you avoid the mistakes I made.

After I invented the Symmetry Live I tried to built it but realized that I didn't know what I was doing. I then shortly after had a child in 2008 while I was attempting a to be a down-tempo electronic musician. I needed a good job so I reenrolled in a transfer degree program at LCC to study electronics.

My baby's mother went down the toilet and I lost custody of my son to my son's maternal grandmother because I could not afford an attorney and she told a bunch of lies you would need to be an attorney to have caught and I didn't do my legal research. I had to be my own attorney, write countless hours of court papers, and loose in court multiple times.

I eventually transferred Portland State University (PSU) in 2010 for a BS in computer engineering, and shortly after stopped playing music and did engineering non-stop as a basement dweller in the PSU Engineering Building. I was fortunate enough to get a small grant from the Oregon Lottery IDA Program to get enough electronics making equipment where I had a nice lab to be a broke college student and invent in. I worked tirelessly all day for years.

Everything was going good until half way through my junior year. I used up too much financial aid at LCC, the school didn't tell me I was going to run out, and I had to drop out in 2013, which is when the work on this book began. I got into the Eugene Startup scene through startup events at the Fertilab Thinkubator, a business accelerator in Eugene and I worked on my technology and went to startup events for years.

During this time I invented Script and started the Kabuki Toolkit from my 3D graphics work. From the years of 2008 through 2018 I worked all by myself with no help and it was miserable. I was stuck at my mom's house, I could only see my son 1/3 of the time. I was so traumatizing that I developed PTSD from Legal Abuse Syndrome, which is where you're traumatized by being innocent and convicted guilty because you have to live in a prolonged state of trauma.

During this time I built sound cards, power supplies, light controllers, MIDI controllers, plant watering controllers, a genetic polygonal shape finder, invented a software-defined network protocol (i.e. internet that can morph over time), designed a professional C++ SDK, wrote two books, made lots of art, designed a self-assembling photonic neural net, and taught kids how to program video games in my free time through the CoderDojo (which is a super cool place to volunteer BTW).

It was a lot of work. I started without newb engineering skills, I got distracted by every shinny object, and I was not able to complete my first product, my baby the Symmetry Live, in a timely manner without the knowledge in this book. I eventually had a mid-life crisis. It was a crushing defeat I would not wish on my worse enemies because it would cause an innocent child to suffer. I had no money, no girlfriend, very few friends, and limited time with my beloved son.

I eventually made it back to PSU in 2016 because the tuition costs gave me some more financial aid, then discovered my son's maternal grandmother had committed fraud. School was hassling me over some failed classes and it caused the PTSD to return. It wasn't just a little bit bad, it was rock bottom; though a dope addict may have a much worse rock bottom story, it was my rock bottom. The only ray of hope in my life was Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, Entrepreneurship, and Design (STEM-ED). So I suffered trough engineering school as a basement dweller locked up in a closet with the rest of the grad students and I hacked on code till I had a competitive product I could sell that I was proud.

Over this time I learned the techniques in this book in order to teach myself to stop getting distracted by shinny objects and actually get the work done. Much of this book is coming from the perspective of Chief Technology Officer who is a poor CEO and over explains fine details in a distracting confusing way. I had to learn to tone down the geek speech, be ultra productive, compete in today's rapidly changing technology landscape, and keep laser focus using the techniques described in this book.

Eventually, because of getting back into engineering school and studying some AI, I came across the notion of treating startups like a finite state machine, and applying artificial intelligence to maximize the chances of success using the Business Model Canvases State Machine, and this book's place in history was then set. This book is about training your Startup State Machine to get accurate and precise cost and weight calculations and analytics and to minimize time to market and development costs and maximize flow state development time and product quality.

## 1.4 Mission and Vision Statement

Mission Statements and Vision Statements are one of the most powerful documents your startup has; they are your startup's North Star that keeps everyone headed the same direction. When working with professionals, you shouldn't need to tell them how to do there job. You hired them because they know how to do that and you don't have the time to do that. This means that often times people have their heads down in the sand and everyone is digging towards the goal. This is the fastest way to get to the goal, but if the team is digging in the wrong direction it can lead the team astray, waste time, and jeopardize the project. The Mission and Vision should serve as the North Start that keeps the team coordinated and digging in the right direction.

There is a difference between a goal and mission. Often times people confuse the Mission and Vision with what ever goal they are excited about at that time and whatever they think will bring in more customers. This is not the Mission and Vision, it's **A** vision and **A** mission, and in fact may jeopardize the mission. The mission is whatever is best for your product and customer, and every professional mission includes the sub-mission to keep team from getting distracted and digging off coarse.

You really do want to start off with the right dream and not a pipe dream. It is critical from the start to define a official well thought out and useful Mission and Vision Statement. Necessity of the mother of all inventions, so the Mission statement should always start out with a need.

Another critical aspect of the Mission and Vision is that they must be complimentary and they must not compete with each other for the teams precious time. If your mission is to produce world-class software and your vision is to give it away for free, this may or may not be a conflict of interest. The very least you should do up front is write down at least one sentence addressing if a conflict of interest exists and if so what is the mitigating factor that makes the conflict not critical.

The mission of Astartup is to maximize the chances of success of your startup by teaching as many people as possible modern industry best practices, time optimization techniques, and Artificial Intelligence theory, and to provide free software tools to assist you in this task.

The vision of Astartup is to provide a free Markdown version of the book to all, regardless of ability to pay; and earn money by selling paper books, solely because paper books are awesome and startups need money; any money generated will be used to fund Kabuki Starship.

#### Mission and Vision State Analyses

The mission is clear and easy to understand  because it is defined in mathematical terms of maximizing the chance of success. The book is completely useless if it lowers your chance of success, so maximizing the chance is the opposite of useless and therefor provides a solution to the user that is a pain that is great enough for the user to buy a paper copy of this book.

The vision is clear and easy to understand because everyone could use a good free book, free books is the only way to get a book to everyone in the world, and it only makes sense to sell paper copies.

The mission and vision of the Astartup are complimentary because giving the book away for free along with selling paper copies maximizes the number of readers while preserving potential profits from book sales and teaching classes and workshops.

The giving away of the book for free in markdown form does not conflict with the Mission and Vision of the parent company because the parent company because the parent company business model is not selling books because the primary product is software, hardware, and cloud-based services, and provides a consulting service that is complimentary to the parent company's business model and objectives.

In order to do what the book proposes, we need some open-source software and a revenue stream. It's not a super difficult implementation and it would be pretty easy to knock off, and we would greatly benefit from crowd-sourcing the book to tap the knowledge of the international community by making it easy to contribute. By open-sourcing the software that goes with the book the chances of success go up and the cost of the development go down through the floor. This is compatible with the MinMax math behind Astartup.

The Mission and Vision does not compete with the parent company for resources because the knowledge in the book is used to both train employees and make development processes more efficient.

## 1.5 Markdown

This book is focused on time optimization and makes heavy use of Markdown. Markdown is the text format used in Wikipedia and many popular websites. It is useful because it's barebones, doesn't have any distracting menus to waste time in, and it increases productivity by allowing you to focus on the content not the software. You can learn Markdown in a matter of hours, and you can get away with only knowing a limited number of tags.

Markdown is also exceptionally useful for copying and pasting code snippets and math formulas because it has syntax highlighting and depending on the implementation it may support LaTeX and/or MathJax.

We'll want to edit a lot of (hopefully) small Markdown files so we'll want to use a text editor that has a filesystem tree browser; built-in Markdown syntax highlighting is nice but not mandatory. One the best Markdown Editors available is the Atom editor at https://atom.io/. Atom has an integrated Markdown previewer as well as integrated git revision history that we'll covert in Chapter 2: Development Processes. Another good open-source markdown viewer is VNote at https://tamlok.github.io/vnote/. VNote makes it easier to work with images and has VIM shortcuts.

## 1.6 Workspace

Your workspace is critical to your success. Some find your workspace is best on a laptop, others, including myself, feel most productive behind a desktop because there the dedicated equipment takes less time to use and there a defined start of shift ritual, which we'll cover more in Chapter 6: Productivity. The most important part is that you are able to quickly get to work and have minimal distractions, and that it is affordable.

Your workspace folder is where you keep all of the folders for the projects, startups, and businesses that you work on and for. Throughout this book when the term workspace is used, it means the workspace folder, not the physical workspace. You don't want any junk or random files in your workspace, only a bunch of subfolders for the various components of our startup, business, projects, etc.

## 1.7 Repositories

Repositories, repo or repos for short, are folders that contains the computer files for your startup that you need to backup and synchronize (which should be everything but the junk and maybe some of the junk but not all.). You should have one Administrative, or Admin, Repository for your start as well as an individual repository for every product.

The Administrative, or Admin, Repository is the central folder for your startup that requires Admin access to view and modify. This is a critical repository that contains the high-level business files for your startup.

Project Repositories should be self contained, meaning they contain every file needed for the product to work correctly, with the exception of including third-party repos. The golden rules is that repeated files has repeated errors in them. It is best to have every module as self contained as possible, and import the primary repo so you get all of the most current files. This is not possible however in every situation but please keep in mind that it is a major pain in the rear to have to fix the same bug over and over again. The goal of the repo is to increase the quality of the product while reducing the labor costs so do what is  best to accomplish this goal.

## 1.8 Summary

This chapter outlined the reasons for the invention of the Astartup and AStar Development and the general concept of why it's useful. The preface outlines some of the reasons why the knowledge in the book is important and how it could save your startup. The Mission and Vision Statement introduced you to how to unify the startups goals and objectives to create the original dream and keep the team digging towards the goal as fast as possible. The Repository section drew a box around what is and out of the repo.

## 1.9 Exercises

**1**. Get your computer ready:

**A**. Download and install the Atom editor at https://atom.io/, Notepad++ for Windows, or similar text editor with Tree Filesystem Browser.

**B**. Create a folder for your startup on your computer. The preferred workspace location is in `C:\workspace` or `\workspace\` on Unix-like systems because it helps preserve hard file links. This folder is going to be called the Repository.

**Optional**: For those who use multiple computers who wish to do so, create your workspace on an external hard drive, preferably on an M2 External SSD, and create a symbolic link to the drive in the Workspace Directory. This will eliminate redundant pushes to the repository when you switch computers. Laptop users may wish to attach some magnetic tap to the M2 SSD so they can stick it to the back of their laptop monitor. Plan on loosing this drive at any time.

**C**. In the `$root/workspace/$company_name` folder create a text file called README.md, open the file in a text editor, and write down the name of your business, or make up one if you don't have one.

**2**. Define your product:

**A**. Create a folder for your product, or for each of your products if you have more than one, in the `$root/workspace` directory.

**B**. Define your product in one sentence, then create a detail description of the product that defines the who, what, when, where, why, and how your product does what it does.

**C**. Define the problem the user is having that is painful enough that they would be interested in paying for or using your product or service.

**D**. Define how your product or service is the best solution for your customer.

**3**. Define your audience:

**A**. List some classes of people you intend to provide services to.

**B**. List some reasons why you want to provide your services to these people.

**C**. List some reasons why you think people would be interested in paying you for your solution over existing services; or if your solution is nonprofit, list reasons why users would be willing to use your solution over the existing solutions.

**D**. Redefine your answer for problem 2.D. how your product or service is the best solution for your customer now that you've defined your audience.

**4**. Draft your startup's and product's Mission and Vision Statement:

**C**. In the README.md file in the Admin Repo and Product(s) Repo(s), draft Mission and Vision Statements for both the product/service and startup.

**D**. Verify that your missions and visions do not conflict with one another.

**E**. Tell to at least five friends, family members, or fellow students your mission and vision statements and take notes about what they told.
