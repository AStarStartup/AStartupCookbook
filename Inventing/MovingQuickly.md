### Moving Quickly

Some of the most important metrics to optimize for the success of your invention are time to market, confusion time, development time, testing time, feedback time, iteration time, and [@todo insert more common metrics]. It’s imperative to move quickly through the process and not get hung up on the way. This does not mean to rush the task, as that will almost guarantee an exponential amount of rework later on. Getting bogged down in the muck of a project can significantly decrease morale, which in turns leads to decreased productivity (quote from Getting Things Done – Allan).

In order to move quickly, it’s important to document what you are doing. Keeping detailed notes and journals.
Write Down It Down Before You Forget It

This is one of the main themes of the book: how to document your ideas properly. I want students to write for someone else who doesn’t know all of the intricacies of the project.

[Data on how short the human attention span is]

Often, when you take on a large project, and you take a break and come back to it later, you will forget what you did. Now image if you are working as an engineer for a big company coming into to replace the spacey engineer who just got fired. If you can’t even remember what you did on your own project, how can you expect someone else to be able to come in and take over your job?

One tip for when you’re on a computer writing. If you are working on a large document and you get the inspiration to work on another section and you need to write down your thought before move search for the place you were going to insert it into. The reason for this being is that often when you are working with a large document, it takes a while to find the place where you want to insert it. This can often time take enough time to find the place that you will forget what you were going to write. If you write the idea down ahead of time, you can just copy and paste it into where it should be.
