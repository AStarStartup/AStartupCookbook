### Agreements

#### Group Ownership Agreements

#### Non-disclosure Agreements

#### No-competition Agreements

No-competition Agreements (NCA or NCAs) are agreements you sign that prevent you from competing with an agent. Most engineer’s and project managers think that they're a complete joke but it's not. NCAs can shut you're startup down! Never sign an NCA without an attorney and manager looking at it first.
