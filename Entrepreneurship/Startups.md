Lean Startup is a variation of Agile Development combined with customer Entrepreneurship gathered both with software and in person that allow the organization to focus on the features the customer is most interested in.

#### Gloom and Doom

Statics don't lie, 90% of startups fail[1]. Don't proceed if you think it's going to be a walk in the park and everything will happen right away. Startups take time and there is plenty of gloom and doom.

At the same time, this means that there is plenty of room for women and minorities in business. The hardest part is first building a product that solves enough customer need to make enough money to compete in today's market, second is self-care, third recruiting a team, fourth not be homeless, and fifth completing the product in within the market window. Many of these things are completely out of your control.
