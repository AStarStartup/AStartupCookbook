### Eastern Philosophy

#### Dharma

Dharma is one's duty to society and is a beleif system shared between Hinuism, Buddism, Sekism. Everyone has their purpose in life. Running a startup company usually means living off of pennies, it takes a lot longer than in you initially think it will take you, and it's not so glamarous. If you have a long-term incubation startup then chances are by the time you finish your product you're life's trajectory will change and you will have different interests. Optimizing ahead of time for Dharma is a way that you can keep focused on the public good, which can give you long-term percerveriance. A side affect of the Dharma-centered design is that since you are helping people, it can often times make you more money in the end because your product is mass marketable.

#### Buddhism

##### Enlightenment

##### Mindfulness

One of the biggest time savers that increase productivity is simply being aware of things, or in other words, being mindful of things. Mindfulness is a Buddhist concept means awareness. The Buddha taught that it was one of the seven factors of enlightenment.

Take for instance, that you’re on a narrow bridge going over a canyon hundreds of feet above the floor that has no side rails. What the fool would do is skip across the bridge, turning around, saying “lah de dah dah dah”, and not thinking about the imminent danger to either side of him, leading them to fall to their doom. What the scared person would do, is be so afraid, that they were petrified about looking over the edge, and either back out, freak out and need help, or fall off the edge from vertigo. But the mindful person would be aware that their fear, and/or their lack of concern could kill them, and so the mindful person will walk the middle path without fear, without looking down, and without looking back.

This is a concept that can really help you go far in life, and is a very powerful too when applied to writing. When you write, you need to keep your mind focused on the overall goal. What are you trying to achieve with your writing? Who is going to read it? Why are they reading it? Is there a common goal among your readers? Does your language and writing style help or hinder your audience? You can write the most technical paper on earth about how to create a Volcano out of baking soda and vinegar down the molecular level, but would that help out a 5th-grade science teacher? No, chances are that most children wouldn’t have the ability to compensate it; let alone understand it. Instead, it’s better to save some time, and figure out what information would be helpful to a child that can further their personal development, and lead them to the logical next step. What else are they learning at the time that you can tie it into? If you aren’t mindful, to begin with, you’re going to come up with something the reader doesn’t want to read.

Sometimes it can be hard to be mindful of the overall direction of a project when you are down in the weeds of it. It is important to be mindful of what are the primary goals you are trying to achieve. Often it is wise, pending you have the staff to support it, to isolate people doing low-level work from the tasks of the person doing the high-level work. If this is not possible, then it is important to separate the time that you
Walking the Middle Path

Another important in Buddhism is walking the middle path. Being an entrepreneur means taking on a lot of extra responsibility.

The famous philosopher Nietzsche taught that “the future influences the present as much as the past.”
It is important to weigh all of your options. In general, you want to follow the path followed by successful people. Occasionally though you will find yourself faced with situations of great risk.
Humility

One of the most important traits in an engineer is that they be humble. Representatives from major companies such as Google have been quoted as saying that students from really good schools who get really good grades often.

#### Taoism

#### The Wu Wei

The Wu Wei is a Taoist concept that means non-action, non-doing; also commonly referred to as action through inaction.
Writing for most people when you first start doing is very arduous and frustrating because it takes so long. The reason for this is the same frustrating that almost anyone feels when learning a new skill. You aren’t proficient in that skill, so you have to try so much harder just to get the ball rolling, but after you learn how to do it, you don’t have to put in as much effort because you know how to start, and how to get the work done in a timely manner.

Image this, you’re trying to move a small boulder, and you have no tools. An unwise person would push the rock at awkward angles, use all of their strength, and fail to move the boulder. A wise person would use their head and instead find a point on the boulder that they could make use of leverage, and move the boulder with very little effort. This is the essence of the wu we1. You should need to put in a lot of effort.

Anyone who has done a lot of math can tell you if it is taking you a really long time to figure out your homework, it means that you're just not studying it right. Don’t just beat your head against the wall. Take a break, get your mind off of it, and come back fresh. Ask a friend, go to a tutor, but don’t waste your time going in circles. It will just stress you out and make you not want to learn it. Utilize the wu wei.

Meditation is much the same way. Buddhist have long taught that, touch that
