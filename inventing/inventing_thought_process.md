### Inventing Thought Process

There isn't one set formula for inventing obviously, but inventors and serial entrepreneurs do share some common traits, and percerverience is on the top of the list along with luck. Thomas Edison took thousands of tries until he finally invented the light bulb.

#### Opening your Mind

The longer you go as inventer the easier it is to be open-minded because you slowly over the years discover that you were wrong about a lot of stuff on a regular basis and over the years a good inventor will slowly learn to be their own biggest skeptic.
