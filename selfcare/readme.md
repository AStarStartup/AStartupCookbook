# SelfCare

This coursework is very intensive. The most important thing is to separate your work time, from your personal time. Overworking yourself will just cause you to burn out, and not be productive. Studies have shown that people are x percent more efficient and productive when they aren’t stressed out.

[Insert data about how stress lowers your productivity levels]

When working In teams of people, it’s important to not get frustrated with people. Bad vibes = no work getting done. One problem with stressing out is that it drains your energy for up to days after the stress-out occurred. One of the top 3 traits in people that are very likable is that they handle stressful situations without overreacting.
Plan on Working 60 Hours a Week with More Breaks

In order to succeed as a startup or startup within a startup, you are going to have to put in at least 60 hours a week. You’re going to have to work at least 20 hours a week to pay the bills, and you’re going to have to work full-time for yourself. It’s extremely important that you don’t burn yourself out.

Don’t be fooled by thinking that if you’re not being productive, and you make up for it by working overtime, that somehow it will magically fix the problem. It won’t. Working 60-100 hours a week won’t fix your problem. You have to have a personal life. It’s not really possible to have a personal life when you’re working 16 hours a day 7 days a week. Mark my words, you’re going to crack.
