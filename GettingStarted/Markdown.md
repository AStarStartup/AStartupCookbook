### Markdown

This book is focused on time optimization and makes heavy use of Markdown. Markdown is the text format used in Wikipedia and many popular websites. It is useful because it's bare-bones, doesn't have any distracting menus to waste time in, and it increases productivity by allowing you to focus on the content not the software. You can learn Markdown in a matter of hours, and you can get away with only knowing a limited number of tags.

Markdown is also exceptionally useful for copying and pasting code snippets and math formulas because it has syntax highlighting and depending on the implementation it may support LaTeX and/or MathJax.

We'll want to edit a lot of (hopefully) small Markdown files so we'll want to use a text editor that has a filesystem tree browser; built-in Markdown syntax highlighting is nice but not mandatory. One the best Markdown Editors available is the Atom editor at https://atom.io/. Atom has an integrated Markdown previewer as well as integrated git revision history that we'll covert in Chapter 2: Development Processes. Another good open-source markdown viewer is VNote at https://tamlok.github.io/vnote/. VNote makes it easier to work with images and has VIM shortcuts.
