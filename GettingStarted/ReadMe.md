This is a living book that contains engineering best practices to launch a startup based on an invention with a little bit of help from artificial intelligence using a piece of software called the Astartup-bot, named after the A-Star (A*) Algorithm. The book's purpose is in the hopes of helping you and your company does not make the same mistakes I made with my first startup company that was such a heartache for me and my son.

This book works in combination with other references documents throughout this book and is not meant to be a primary source of information for any of the subjects cited; you need to go to engineering school for that and the book would span several foreboding volumes. Each skill area touched upon is a full-time job in and of itself. This book is aiming to introduce you to the industry best practices from various disciplines and to use a little bit of AI theory to help optimize your scheduler to help you quickly scale your project/startup to compete in the rapidly evolving **EXTREMELY** competitive international market.

In a way, your entire life is a startup company, you just didn't know it. Startups usually have an 85% chance of failure, which is unacceptable to you. One way to boost your odds is to use AI, so if this interests you this is the book for you.

Each chapter in the book (will) contain(s) a case study of a inventor or entrepreneur that has a valuable lesson to learn about the subject of that chapter #WorkInProgress. Kabuki Toolkit (will then) contain(s) some open-source tools to help you optimize your schedule with that technique. Want to invent like Thomas Edison or Albert Einstein, or be as quirky as Elon Musk? Keep reading and submit your code to the Kabuki Toolkit at <https://github.com/KabukiStarship/KabukiToolkit/>.
