## 3.2 Documenting Inventions

The content of this book is a combination of technical writing, engineering, mixed with a crash course in running a startup company. The purpose of this book is to teach students how to leverage writing as a tool to aid in the inventing process, create a superior product, and launch a successful business off of your invention. It is not meant to serve as your primary source of information about the subjects in this book. For all of those subjects, it is recommended that you read the primary literature referenced in this book. The idea of this book is to teach students to document their ideas correctly in the correct way. Learning how to solve problems is not something that they teach you in primary school. The purpose of this book is to train you to think like an engineer, inventor, and entrepreneur from the very start.

The book is written to the audience of people who already have inventions that they have been working on but those who do not have a project please plan on creating one to work or join another team to work through the book. Heavy emphasis is put on writing. Writing is arguably one of the most important tools you have in your toolkit in every professional and scientist’s life. The perspective of this book is coming from an amateur inventor attempting to launch a startup company off of their invention. While I am focusing on the amateur inventor, this book also applies to engineers, scientists, and masters of business. If you have an MBA, the book will function as a quick review of the Lean Startup Method, and also some valuable insight into how engineers and inventors invent, and how you can document your ideas for your next hot new startup company.

Another goal of this book is that I want to teach inventors to be ready to take on a co-founder, or team at any point in time in the development process. My biggest problem when I first started engineering school, when I had access to the resources of top-notch engineering facilities, I was not set up to take on anyone on my team because I did not have the proper project management tools and training.

The sad reality of launching an invention start is that sometimes, no one is going to work on your project. It’s hard for many inventors who are emotionally attached to their inventions to see this, but it is critical that you plan for this if you actually care about the project. Not only will learn how to do this speed up your own product development time and time to market, but it will also increase your chances of luring in a co-founder.
Soft Skills

[Insert some quote about how engineering graduates are graduating with more technical knowledge, but not enough soft skills]

Soft skills include communication skills, and the ability to work in groups. This is why I have included the sections on group collaboration tools. Technical writing in the industry is done around the schedule of business and technology and product development. It is important when writing documentation for your invention that you have practice using these tools while you are working on projects. By becoming familiar with the tools and techniques, you will become better at writing more useful documentation for the people who are going to read it.

## 3.2 Inventing Techniques

There are three Box Inventing Techniques: Black Box, White Box, and Grey Box.

## 3.2.a Black Box

This section is about how amateur inventors are looking into a black box and they are making up stuff in their heads about how the machine works. This is very valuable insight because it can give us a baseline.

## 3.2.b White Box

## 3.2.c Grey Box

## 3.3 Story Boards

## 3.4 Inventing Styles

## 3.4.a Group Inventing

The best way to learn is in groups. Attempting to launch a startup company by yourself is usually a recipe for disaster. Part of this book will teach you how to recruit a team and find investors. This is as important for the success of your business as your product itself.

What most smart amateurs think when they first get into a business, is that they can do everything themselves and that they can’t trust anyone else to do it right. The problem with that line of thinking that most young people don’t understand is that you have a very limited amount of time and number of things that you can afford to spend your time on.
Working with other people also keeps you motivated. It's way too easy to get solo inventor fatigue and have your entire project poop out on you. That is every inventor’s worst nightmare.

## 3.5 Moving Quickly

Some of the most important metrics to optimize for the success of your invention are time to market, confusion time, development time, testing time, feedback time, iteration time, and [@todo insert more common metrics]. It’s imperative to move quickly through the process and not get hung up on the way. This does not mean to rush the task, as that will almost guarantee an exponential amount of rework later on. Getting bogged down in the muck of a project can significantly decrease morale, which in turns leads to decreased productivity (quote from Getting Things Done – Allan).

In order to move quickly, it’s important to document what you are doing. Keeping detailed notes and journals.
Write Down It Down Before You Forget It

This is one of the main themes of the book: how to document your ideas properly. I want students to write for someone else who doesn’t know all of the intricacies of the project.

[Data on how short the human attention span is]

Often, when you take on a large project, and you take a break and come back to it later, you will forget what you did. Now image if you are working as an engineer for a big company coming into to replace the spacey engineer who just got fired. If you can’t even remember what you did on your own project, how can you expect someone else to be able to come in and take over your job?

One tip for when you’re on a computer writing. If you are working on a large document and you get the inspiration to work on another section and you need to write down your thought before move search for the place you were going to insert it into. The reason for this being is that often when you are working with a large document, it takes a while to find the place where you want to insert it. This can often time take enough time to find the place that you will forget what you were going to write. If you write the idea down ahead of time, you can just copy and paste it into where it should be.

## 3.6 Basic Drawing Skills

Part of this course will be emphasizing basic drawing skills. Throughout the structure of your class, you will be asked to draw several sketches for designs. If you are not a skilled artist or have not had the luxury of taking an art class in recent years, this can be quite a challenge.

## 3.7 Philosophy

### 3.7.a Dharma

Dharma is one's duty to society. Everyone has their purpose in life. Running a startup company usually means living off of pennies.

### 3.7.b Buddhism

#### Enlightenment

#### Mindfulness

One of the biggest time savers that increase productivity is simply being aware of things, or in other words, being mindful of things. Mindfulness is a Buddhist concept means awareness. The Buddha taught that it was one of the seven factors of enlightenment.

Take for instance, that you’re on a narrow bridge going over a canyon hundreds of feet above the floor that has no side rails. What the fool would do is skip across the bridge, turning around, saying “lah de dah dah dah”, and not thinking about the imminent danger to either side of him, leading them to fall to their doom. What the scared person would do, is be so afraid, that they were petrified about looking over the edge, and either back out, freak out and need help, or fall off the edge from vertigo. But the mindful person would be aware that their fear, and/or their lack of concern could kill them, and so the mindful person will walk the middle path without fear, without looking down, and without looking back.

[Insert literature about Buddhism]

This is a concept that can really help you go far in life, and is a very powerful too when applied to writing. When you write, you need to keep your mind focused on the overall goal. What are you trying to achieve with your writing? Who is going to read it? Why are they reading it? Is there a common goal among your readers? Does your language and writing style help or hinder your audience? You can write the most technical paper on earth about how to create a Volcano out of baking soda and vinegar down the molecular level, but would that help out a 5th-grade science teacher? No, chances are that most children wouldn’t have the ability to compensate it; let alone understand it. Instead, it’s better to save some time, and figure out what information would be helpful to a child that can further their personal development, and lead them to the logical next step. What else are they learning at the time that you can tie it into? If you aren’t mindful, to begin with, you’re going to come up with something the reader doesn’t want to read.

Sometimes it can be hard to be mindful of the overall direction of a project when you are down in the weeds of it. It is important to be mindful of what are the primary goals you are trying to achieve. Often it is wise, pending you have the staff to support it, to isolate people doing low-level work from the tasks of the person doing the high-level work. If this is not possible, then it is important to separate the time that you
Walking the Middle Path

Another important in Buddhism is walking the middle path. Being an entrepreneur means taking on a lot of extra responsibility.

The famous philosopher Nietzsche taught that “the future influences the present as much as the past.”
It is important to weigh all of your options. In general, you want to follow the path followed by successful people. Occasionally though you will find yourself faced with situations of great risk.
Humility

One of the most important traits in an engineer is that they be humble. Representatives from major companies such as Google have been quoted as saying that students from really good schools who get really good grades often.

### 3.7.c The Wu Wei

The Wu Wei is a Taoist concept that means non-action, non-doing; also commonly referred to as action through inaction.
Writing for most people when you first start doing is very arduous and frustrating because it takes so long. The reason for this is the same frustrating that almost anyone feels when learning a new skill. You aren’t proficient in that skill, so you have to try so much harder just to get the ball rolling, but after you learn how to do it, you don’t have to put in as much effort because you know how to start, and how to get the work done in a timely manner.

Image this, you’re trying to move a small boulder, and you have no tools. An unwise person would push the rock at awkward angles, use all of their strength, and fail to move the boulder. A wise person would use their head and instead find a point on the boulder that they could make use of leverage, and move the boulder with very little effort. This is the essence of the wu we1. You should need to put in a lot of effort.

Anyone who has done a lot of math can tell you if it is taking you a really long time to figure out your homework, it means that you're just not studying it right. Don’t just beat your head against the wall. Take a break, get your mind off of it, and come back fresh. Ask a friend, go to a tutor, but don’t waste your time going in circles. It will just stress you out and make you not want to learn it. Utilize the wu wei.

Meditation is much the same way. Buddhist have long taught that, touch that

### 3.7.d Formal Arguments

### 3.7.e Critical Thinking

Critical thinking is something that should be taught to school children from a very young age. Our society is often times used faith as a crutch, often to entrench and protect our own paradigms. The phrase “I read it on the internet so it must be true” optimizes problem to the status of a meme. Far too often, people assume that everything that was spoken in a serious tone is true. Often times this is so far from the truth you in between wanting to laugh or being afraid. While this book is not a book about critical thinking or eastern philosophy, they are important for anyone wanting to invent or bring an innovative product to market.

[Insert info about how critical thinking can help you write here.]

Critical Thinking is the staple of every technical writer. The most important thing to take away from it is to be able to recognize when you’re in fact territory. You can’t cite every last technical detail, because that would distract readers from the overall point, so it’s important to be able to identify the important fact critical to your argument, from common knowledge.
