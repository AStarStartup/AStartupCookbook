# Documentation

When doing engineering, there are four main types of documents that you will use:

	* Whitepaper
	* Development Log
	* Engineering Requirements Document
	* Engineering Specifications Document
	* Project Timeline
	* Wiki

One of the primary reasons for writing documentation is to be able to collaborate with other people, whether that be a client or a developer. The point is to be able to describe what youâ€™re doing in words, such that another person skilled in the arts can reproduce a behavior using your documentation.
