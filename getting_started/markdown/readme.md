### Markdown

Markdown is a plane text document format similar to HTML, popularized by Wikipedia, GitHub, and many popular websites. It is useful because it's bare-bones, can be mixed with HTML, doesn't have any distracting menus to waste time in, and it increases productivity by allowing you to focus on the content not the software. You can learn Markdown in a matter of hours, and you can get away with only knowing a limited number of tags.

Markdown is also exceptionally useful for copying and pasting code snippets and math formulas because it has syntax highlighting and depending on the implementation it may support LaTeX and/or MathJax.

We'll want to edit a lot of (hopefully) small Markdown files so we'll want to use a text editor that has a filesystem tree browser; built-in Markdown syntax highlighting is nice but not mandatory. One the best Markdown Editors available is the Atom editor at <https://atom.io/>. Atom has an integrated Markdown previewer as well as integrated git revision history that we'll covert in Chapter 2: Development Processes. Another good open-source markdown viewer is VNote at <https://tamlok.github.io/vnote/>. VNote makes it easier to work with images and has VIM shortcuts.

Markdown templates are a useful starting point for your project that allow you to get started right away. Kabuki Starship provides free Markdown templates and recipes for different industries you can use to start your project:

* [App Templates](./app_templates.md)
* [Game Templates](./game_templates.md)

After you have followed the recipe for the template for your project, if you need to create documentation for your project you want to following [Cook Templates recipe](./markdown_cookbook.md).
