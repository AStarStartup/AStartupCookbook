This is a living book that contains engineering best practices to launch a startup based on an invention with a little bit of help from I am You Language and the Astartup web-app. The book's purpose is in the hopes of helping you and your company does not make the same mistakes I made with my first startup company that was such a heartache for me and my son.

This book works in combination with other references documents throughout this book and is not meant to be a primary source of information for any of the subjects cited; you need to go to engineering school for that and the book would span several foreboding volumes. Each skill area touched upon is a full-time job in and of itself. This book is aiming to introduce you to the industry best practices from various disciplines and to use a little bit of AI theory to help optimize your scheduler to help you quickly scale your project/startup to compete in the rapidly evolving **EXTREMELY** competitive international market.

In a way, your entire life is a startup company, you just didn't know it. Startups usually have an 85% chance of failure, which is unacceptable to you. One way to boost your odds is to use AI, so if this interests you this is the book for you.

Each chapter in the book (will) contain(s) a case study of a inventor or entrepreneur that has a valuable lesson to learn about the subject of that chapter #WorkInProgress. Kabuki Toolkit (will then) contain(s) some open-source tools to help you optimize your schedule with that technique. Want to invent like Thomas Edison or Albert Einstein, or be as quirky as Elon Musk? Keep reading and submit your code to the Kabuki Toolkit at <https://github.com/kabuki-starship/kabuki.toolkit/>.

Your workspace is critical to your success so this section is going to walk you through getting your workspace setup using Visual Studio Code as the primary Markdown editor. Your workspace folder is where you keep all of the folders for the projects, startups, and businesses that you work on and for. Throughout this book when the term workspace is used, it means the workspace folder, not the physical workspace. You don't want any junk or random files in your workspace, only a bunch of subfolders for the various components of our startup, business, projects, etc. Some find your workspace is best on a laptop, others, including myself, feel most productive behind a desktop because there the dedicated equipment takes less time to use and there a defined start of shift ritual, which we'll cover more in Chapter 6: Productivity. The most important part is that you are able to quickly get to work and have minimal distractions, and that it is affordable.
