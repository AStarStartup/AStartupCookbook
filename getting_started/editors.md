# [Astartup Cookbook](../../readme.md)

## [Getting Started](../readme.md)

### [Editors](./readme.md)

We'll want to edit a lot of (hopefully) small Markdown files, which we'll cover more about in the next section, so we'll want to use a text editor that has a filesystem tree browser; built-in Markdown syntax highlighting is nice but not mandatory. This book uses [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as the default Markdown editor to allow for a single set of instructions, but there are other good Markdown editors and you can easily convert the recipes on the fly. Another good editor is the Atom editor at <https://atom.io/>. Atom has an integrated Markdown previewer as well as integrated git revision history that we'll covert in Chapter 2: Development Processes. This books also makes use of the Unified Modeling Language, and we use [StarUML](https://staruml.io).

Markdown Editors and IDEs use a concept called Workspace folders. To setup your workspace folder with VS Code and StarUML:

**1.** Create a workspace directory. It is recommended for Windows users to use the folder `C:\workspace` because it helps preserve absolute folder references when switching computer workstations:

```Bash
cd C:
mkdir workspace
```

**2.** Download and install [StarUML](staruml.io).

**3.** Download VS Code at <https://code.visualstudio.com>, install it, and open the application.

**4.** Right-click on the Explorer and click on `Add folder to workspace`, navigate to your workspace folder, and click Add.
