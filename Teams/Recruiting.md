If you say you have 3 teams of people working in three different countries, regardless of the size or skill level of the teams that just sounds bad ass. You be surprised how willing people from other countries will be to help you out. In order to reach out to the global community, you will need some online collaboration tools. Some of the most important tools will be discussed throughout the course of this book.

Entrepreneur events are some of the best places to recruit co-founders and investors. A lot of times it turns into old-man city and it's pretty boring, but you might run into a retired person looking to invest in a business. You have to think of the startup scene as a haunt. You want to make your fake and business known.
