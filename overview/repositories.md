## Repositories

Repositories, repo or repos for short, are folders that contains the computer files for your startup that you need to backup and synchronize (which should be everything but the junk and maybe some of the junk but not all.). You should have one Administrative, or Admin, Repository for your start as well as an individual repository for every product.

The Administrative, or Admin, Repository is the central folder for your startup that requires Admin access to view and modify. This is a critical repository that contains the high-level business files for your startup.

Project Repositories should be self contained, meaning they contain every file needed for the product to work correctly, with the exception of including third-party repos. The golden rules is that repeated files has repeated errors in them. It is best to have every module as self contained as possible, and import the primary repo so you get all of the most current files. This is not possible however in every situation but please keep in mind that it is a major pain in the rear to have to fix the same bug over and over again. The goal of the repo is to increase the quality of the product while reducing the labor costs so do what is  best to accomplish this goal.
