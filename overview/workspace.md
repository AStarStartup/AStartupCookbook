# Overview
## Workspace

Your workspace is critical to your success. Some find your workspace is best on a laptop, others, including myself, feel most productive behind a desktop because there the dedicated equipment takes less time to use and there a defined start of shift ritual, which we'll cover more in Chapter 6: Productivity. The most important part is that you are able to quickly get to work and have minimal distractions, and that it is affordable.

Your workspace folder is where you keep all of the folders for the projects, startups, and businesses that you work on and for. Throughout this book when the term workspace is used, it means the workspace folder, not the physical workspace. You don't want any junk or random files in your workspace, only a bunch of subfolders for the various components of our startup, business, projects, etc.
