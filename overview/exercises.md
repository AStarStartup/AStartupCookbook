# Overview

## Exercises

**1**. Get your computer ready:

**A**. Download and install the Visual Studio Code Editor editor at <https://code.visualstudio.com/>, Notepad++ for Windows, or similar text editor with Tree Filesystem Browser.

**B**. Create a folder for your startup on your computer. The preferred workspace location is in `C:\workspace` or `\workspace\` on Unix-like systems because it helps preserve hard file links. This folder is going to be called the Repository.

**Optional**: For those who use multiple computers who wish to do so, create your workspace on an external hard drive, preferably on an M2 External SSD, and create a symbolic link to the drive in the Workspace Directory. This will eliminate redundant pushes to the repository when you switch computers. Laptop users may wish to attach some magnetic tap to the M2 SSD so they can stick it to the back of their laptop monitor. Plan on loosing this drive at any time.

**C**. In the `$root/workspace/$company_name` folder create a text file called README.md, open the file in a text editor, and write down the name of your business, or make up one if you don't have one.

**2**. Define your product:

**A**. Create a folder for your product, or for each of your products if you have more than one, in the `$root/workspace` directory.

**B**. Define your product in one sentence, then create a detail description of the product that defines the who, what, when, where, why, and how your product does what it does.

**C**. Define the problem the user is having that is painful enough that they would be interested in paying for or using your product or service.

**D**. Define how your product or service is the best solution for your customer.

**3**. Define your audience:    

**A**. List some classes of people you intend to provide services to.

**B**. List some reasons why you want to provide your services to these people.

**C**. List some reasons why you think people would be interested in paying you for your solution over existing services; or if your solution is nonprofit, list reasons why users would be willing to use your solution over the existing solutions.

**D**. Redefine your answer for problem 2.D. how your product or service is the best solution for your customer now that you've defined your audience.

**4**. Draft your startup's and product's Mission and Vision Statement:

**C**. In the README.md file in the Admin Repo and Product(s) Repo(s), draft Mission and Vision Statements for both the product/service and startup.

**D**. Verify that your missions and visions do not conflict with one another.

**E**. Tell to at least five friends, family members, or fellow students your mission and vision statements and take notes about what they told.

## Summary

This chapter outlined the reasons for the invention of the Astartup and AStar Development and the general concept of why it's useful. The preface outlines some of the reasons why the knowledge in the book is important and how it could save your startup. The Mission and Vision Statement introduced you to how to unify the startups goals and objectives to create the original dream and keep the team digging towards the goal as fast as possible.
