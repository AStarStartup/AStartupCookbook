This is how the Timeshare market works. They given you $100+ to go to a timeshare talk and most people don't buy, but after they go to a few timeshare talks they feel indebted to the timeshare and if they salesman has the right charm, the customer will happily buy an overpriced timeshare when they could easily buy someone else's for half price.
