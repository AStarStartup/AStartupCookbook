### Technical Writing

#### Styles & Formats

One of the jobs of a technical writer is to convey technical data in the most intuitive way possible. It is important that a user to be able to understand the information in as little amount of time as possible.

##### Headings

Making proper use of headings can save you and your team a lot of time and increase productivity. You should think off headings as indentation levels on a bulleted list. You should never have to manually change all of the heading fonts to increase or decrease them.

```
    1. Heading 1
        a. Heading 2
        b. Another Heading 2
            1. Heading 3
            2. Another Heading 3
                1. Heading 4
            3. Even more 3 Headings
    2. Another Heading 1
    3. …
```

Most people put off using headers until the end of their document in order to create the Table of Content (TOC) or Content Table unless they absolutely have to, thinking that the TOC is only useful for the end-user of the document. This is not true. Proper use of the headings from the beginning can also be of great use to the author.

Content tables allow the user to jump around their document using the Navigation Pane. Modern word processing software automatically hyperlinks all heading metadata The Navigation Pane is not visible by default in Word, but can be viewed by clicking on the View Tab and clicking the checkbox that says “Navigation Pane”.

#### Styles

Any word processing document, PDF, or website can search the same way by a search engine. Part of effective writing is helping your audience effectively find the information they seek through proper use of metadata. It’s not too hard to do, as long as you know the basics of how search engines parse documents.
Word Processing software makes this job much easier for writers through the use of styles. When a search engine parses a document,

An easy way to assist your viewers to find the content they need is to put a list of relevant keywords that a user would search for, in a comma-separated list at either the very end of the document or on one of the first handful of pages.

###### Indexing Key Words

#### Mathematical Equations

This section goes over the different ways of getting math equations into the computer.

##### Word Processing Equations Editors

##### LaTeX

LaTex is the most popular math scripting language in use today. It’s a little bit like

##### MathJax

##### Online Tools

If you simply type in equation editor into Google, it will pop up a large query of websites where you can input math formulas. Some will output an image that you can either download or copy and paste into a document. Others will output LaTeX code.

If you are using LaTeX in a word processing document, you can insert the LaTex code as a comment through the following method that I will write about later.
