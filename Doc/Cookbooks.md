### Cookbooks

Creating a cookbook can increase your project's chance of success by creating the Honey pot to attract users to your products by providing the user with free documentation, and the documentation will also have the affect of increasing the quality of your product with Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) documentation. This chapter will cover the creation of a Cookbook using the Markdown Cookbook.

#### Markdown Cookbook Template

The Markdown Cookbook is a template used to create this Cookbook.

**1.**  Clone the Markdown Cookbook recursively.

```Bash
git clone --recursive <https://github.com/CookingWithCale/AStartupCookbook>
```

**2.** Rename all files with `markdown.cookbook` to your cookbook's name.

For windows users use the PowerShell command:

```PowerShell
Dir -recurse | Rename-Item -NewName { $_.Name -replace "markdown.cookbook","your_project.cookbook" }
```
Mac users will use the command:

```PowerShell
```

**3.** Download and install [StarUML](staruml.io), open the `your_project.cookbook.mdj` file, and rename the root to `your_company_name`, and replace all of the copyright information in the Markdown documentation with to copyright holder's name.

**4.** Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

**5.** Open Visual Studio, right click on the workspace and click on `Add Folder to Workspace`, navigate to the clone of this repo and click `Add`.

**6.** Find and replace "Markdown Cookbook" in all files with the name of your Cookbook and `Your Name` with the name of the copyright holder. The license in this book is designed to allow you to sell the Cookbook to fund your project. If you want to change the license just find and replace the entire license line with the desired license.
