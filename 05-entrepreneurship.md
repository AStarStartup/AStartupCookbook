# 5 Entrepreneurship

This chapter is about how to think like an entrepreneur. I still need to read more stuff before I can read this part.
What an entrepreneur says, and what an entrepreneur does, are two different things. Success entrepreneurs think big.
Gloom and Doom

## 5.2.d Sole Ownership

Sole business ownership, or Solopreneurship, can be one lonely miserable existence; it can also make your rich if you do it right (though prepare for bad thoughts). Sometimes it’s better to do a project from start through completion completely by yourself. If you are really into an idea, and you’re the only one around with the skills to do it or have trouble finding people who are motivated, then going solo is your only option. Luckily, this book is still for you. Many of the greatest inventors of all time were solo inventors, such as [List of Solo Inventors]:

## 5.3 Startups

### 5.3.a The Lean Startup Method

Every entrepreneur should probably start by not making the most common mistakes startups make; or rather this is a requirement that might be solved using the Lean Startup Method (Lean Startup). Lean Startup is a variation of Agile Development combined with customer analytics gathered both with software and in person that allow the organization to focus on the features the customer is most interested in.

### 5.3.b Gloom and Doom

Statics don't lie, 90% of startups fail[1]. Don't proceed if you think it's going to be a walk in the park and everything will happen right away. Startups take time and there is plenty of gloom and doom. The sad truth is that women only make up 5 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs, minorities 4%, and 91% of the CEOs of major corporations are white men[2]. At the same time, this means that there is plenty of room for women and minorities in business. The hardest part is first building a product that solves enough customer need to make enough money to compete in today's market, second is self-care, third recruiting a team, fourth not be homeless, and fifth completing the product in within the market window. Many of these things are completely out of your control.

### 5.3.c Elevator Pitches

* Don’t get hung up on features unless they make $$$.
* Focus on why it wins, not why its cool.
* Put off the impression that this is going to happen with or without them so they should get on board now.
* Back of the Envelope Calculations.
* Identifying Potential Business Opportunities.
* Undeserved Markets.

### 5.3.d Proving Customer Needs

This section is about how smart entrepreneurs do their research about where the money is.

### 5.3.e Market Window

### 5.3.f Market Defensibly

To have an IPO-able company, it has to be sustainable and dependable

Put yourself in the Customer’s Shoes

### 5.3.g Customer Visualization

Put yourself in the Customer’s Shoes. Use Case Scenarios.

### 5.3.h Funding

#### Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping is where you fund the startup yourself as you go with sales.

#### Crowdfunding

Crowdfunding is the preferred method because it costs little to no money up front and allows you to test out business ideas without having to put a lot of work into it.

##### Kickstarter

##### Indiegogo

#### Venture Capitalist

Venture Capitalist (VCs) are [Insert definition here]. The different types of VCs are [insert types of VCs here].

* Insert why Kickstarter and Indiegogo are best for testing market needs.
* Insert examples of when you might or might not want to think about a VC.

##### Corporate

Corporate VCs fund companies that help out their business interests.

##### Strategic

Strategic Investments are a temporary investment for short-term gains. It’s a mistake to take money from a strategic VC @ the seed stage sometimes because it can cut you out of deals later. Do your homework.

#### Funding Stages

* Seed
* Early
  * Late
  * Mezzanine
  * Buyout
  * Debt

#### Questions for Investors

* What does the firm do?
* Where do they invest?
* Who do they work with?
* What stages do they focus on?
* Where are they at with their fund timeline?
* When are you going to sell out?

When all is said and done, will I own enough to make this worth my while

## 5.4 Agreements

### 5.4.a Group Ownership Agreements

### 5.4.b Non-disclosure Agreements

### 5.4.c No-competition Agreements

No-competition Agreements (NCA or NCAs) are agreements you sign that prevent you from competing with an agent. Most engineer’s and project managers think that they're a complete joke but it's not. NCAs can shut you're startup down! Never sign an NCA without an attorney and manager looking at it first.

## 5.5 Business Models

## 5.5.a Blades and Razors

## 5.5.b Freemium Model

## 5.6 Business Plans

Back in the day, it was all about the long Business Proposal. Nowadays long business proposals are only useful for very large businesses where the length is due to technical things that dictate it's length. Every business needs a plan, so simple proposals will always be very useful for yourself to organize your startup.

A business plan is composed of nine primary sections. Each section can be as little as a paragraph, or up to several pages depending on complexity. It's good that you write at least one paragraph about each of these topics before you even think about potentially bankrupting yourself of some stupid startup.

## 5.7 Common Pitfalls

This book is meant to serve alongside your starting journey into entrepreneurship. The pace of the book is meant to be very fast pace, at the speed of engineering, and because of this, it’s really important to list out some common pitfalls that amateur plague amateur entrepreneur. Most of these tips can be found any your typical productivity book.
If there is anything I know about running a startup company, it’s how to NOT run a startup company. For years I was plagued by the exact same debilitating problems that most failing business where. Mainly, it stems from not having the resources to mitigate these hazards from the start, whether that be funding or experience.

#### 5.7.a “Buying Stuff for Your Business”

Quote unquote buying stuff for your business when it is really for your own secret wants is a recipe for failure. When you’re starting a startup company, it is extremely important that all of your purchases be extremely targeted. The two most valuable resources that you have are time and money. You need to be an essentialist when it comes to your startup budget. List out what tools and toys you actually need to start generating revenue as soon as possible. Once your generating income, you can buy those toys on your own time with your own money, instead of wasting precious company time and money on stuff that isn’t essential to the success of your business.

#### 5.7b Not Getting Started First Thing in the Morning

I will concede that some people, including myself, can be nocturnal, and this doesn’t apply to everyone, but it does apply to most. If you are serious about your business, you have to make that your life. You can’t wake up and turn on the news and spend hours making breakfast, then dick around on the internet for a few hours before maybe getting in a half hour of spotty work. That is how you fail, hard. That’s personal experience talking.  When I wake up, what I do in the first two hours is what sets the tone for my entire day. A good start in the morning can get multiple days of work done in one. Don’t waste this precious time.

If you’re nocturnal, this does actually still apply to you, one in reverse. The thing about the morning that makes people productive is that it is the time when they are most awake, fresh, and not distracted. For nocturnal people, the times when they’re in the flow are often in the middle of the night before then go to bed. Whatever your body’s schedule is, you need to start making note of when you are most alert and focused and make a routine of working every work day at that time. Set a schedule and don’t deviate even once.

#### 5.7.c Not Prototyping Right Away

It is extremely important for you to get to work right away. One thing that dooms both startups and engineers is not having something to work with soon enough and then not having to opportunity to have that learning experience and first development iteration cycle. It is extremely important that you get your hands on, instead of wasting that time daydreaming about how it works while looking at your wish list. You need to do anything you can to get physical progress on something… anything. This is not to say waste a bunch of precious man-hours on a useless prototype, but you can’t let long periods of time go by when you could have don’t some of the heavy lifting required to get a company off the ground.

## 5.8 Self Care

This coursework is very intensive. The most important thing is to separate your work time, from your personal time. Overworking yourself will just cause you to burn out, and not be productive. Studies have shown that people are x percent more efficient and productive when they aren’t stressed out.

[Insert data about how stress lowers your productivity levels]

When working In teams of people, it’s important to not get frustrated with people. Bad vibes = no work getting done. One problem with stressing out is that it drains your energy for up to days after the stress-out occurred. One of the top 3 traits in people that are very likable is that they handle stressful situations without overreacting.
Plan on Working 60 Hours a Week with More Breaks

In order to succeed as a startup or startup within a startup, you are going to have to put in at least 60 hours a week. You’re going to have to work at least 20 hours a week to pay the bills, and you’re going to have to work full-time for yourself. It’s extremely important that you don’t burn yourself out.

Don’t be fooled by thinking that if you’re not being productive, and you make up for it by working overtime, that somehow it will magically fix the problem. It won’t. Working 60-100 hours a week won’t fix your problem. You have to have a personal life. It’s not really possible to have a personal life when you’re working 16 hours a day 7 days a week. Mark my words, you’re going to crack.
