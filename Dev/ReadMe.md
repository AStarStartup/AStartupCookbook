## Development

This chapter outlines the most important industry standard development processes every beginning tech entrepreneur and inventor needs to know about.

Development Processes are the engineering processes used to design, develop and manage the life cycles of products. Development processes are used to minimize cost and maximize reward. Development processes often times borrow concepts from each other, and are commonly refereed to as the two traditionally distance classes of Development processes, Waterfall-like vs Agile-like Processes.

The best way to think about development processes is that they are project competition rate maximization and completion time minimization optimization techniques; which are two if the most key metrics with startup companies hence why they are at the beginning of the book. Slacking off proper development processes can and almost invariantly will cause a lot of headaches. First that it will greatly increase time and costs to a point that jeopardizes the project, and second that professionals expect you to use the industry standard processes and when you don't use them it makes it hard for the professionals to work.

There are so many different Fill In the Blank Driven Development Processes that it can become somewhat of a shallow buzz word; this is complacency. One of the most important and heavily used development processes reiterated throughout this book is Issue Driven Development (IDD). Studies have proven time after time that people are not good at multitasking, even if they think they are, so the primary principle of this book is to do one thing better, cheaper, and faster than everyone. Throughout your development process, try to put on blinders and choose the correct development pattern that will help you complete your goals in a timely manner with an acceptable product. As you will learn from the lessons in this book that an acceptable product is better than no product.
