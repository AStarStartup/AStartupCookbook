### Broken Windows

Broken windows may be a failed policing strategy because not everyone is a privileged person, but it broken windows can kill a project, startup, or mature business. When you leave many uncompleted tasks in a project, it gives the sense that no one lives there. Most people can do a great job improving software, but not many people can start the process going in the right direction so when you are founding, it is critical to minimize the public-facing broken window count; having a private scrapyard repository is a better choice.

The key metrics we are concerned with to maximize tasks completion rate are

#### Finish One Issue At a Time and Schedule Others

#### Eliminating Road Blocks

#### Setting Reminders

#### Setting Up a Productive Work Environment

#### Setting Priorities
