## 14.1 Case Study: Eric Rese

The lean Astartup method was developed by Eric Reis, a software engineering from Silicon Valley. He was inspired by the Agile programming method and Toyota’s lean manufacturing technique.

## 14.2 Customer Interviews
Customer interviews and peer review are powerful engineering tools and are critical to AStartups success. Sometimes you don’t want to hear what the customer has to say, but you need to listen.

### 14.2.a Interview Tips

For most people, the first few times they conduct customer interviews they will ask loaded questions. You must be very careful to not ask questions you know and want to hear the answer to.

## 14.2.b Interview Forms

## 14.2.c Peer Review

It’s important that all of the work that you do be reviewed at least once in a group session. You can’t expect to just email an engineer your work and expect them to email you back useful information. It’s just too hard to type enough information to be useful. Important issues get overlooked. It’s also important to verbally discuss problems with designs and documents (Insert information about how talking about things makes a more accurate result).

## 14.2.d Online Surveys

## 14.2.e Engineering the Interview

Make a list of who you think your customers might be.

#### Brainstorm questions

Pick the top 10 most important questions. Rate the questions on a scale of one to three and combine relevant questions. Only take the ones.

#### Good types of questions
* How much money does this usually cost you?
* Am I barking up the wrong tree?
Am I wasting my time?
* Would this save you money?

## 14.2.e Interview Materials

* Pen and paper.
* A speakerphone.
* Another person with you to take notes so you don’t have to record it.

Tips:

Don’t pigeonhole yourself into only talking about your product, but instead collect data about their use and needs.
You need to do many interviews so plan on each interview

### 14.2.f Phone Interviews

The idea of this section is that we want to write a document to give to someone so that they can do our phone survey for us.

#### Followups

Thank them for their time.

```
“Is there anyone else I should be talking to about this?”
“Is there anything else that you think we should know?”
```

Don’t close the door, leave it open for them to surprise you.


#### Example Phone Interview

[This is an example phone interview from Lab-2-Market with EA Partners]

A Astartup company is developing a product that measures user’s physiological responses to video games to determine when their peak experiences.

At what point in the game development process will this be more valuable
Is there anything else you think should I know.

What are current game systems?

What is your wish list for data?

At what point in the game would be a better pivot point after getting biometric data.

Notes:
Their testing company is “Game Lab”.

They primarily do usability testing and their typical metric is telemetry data that tells where they get hung up on games or move too quickly.

Eye tracking.
Also see how bored they are.

Would not send code out to individual developers.

Would work better with smaller developers.

Is there some sort of physical/emotion metric that can be tracked?
San Diego based company Edar does most of the game test.
