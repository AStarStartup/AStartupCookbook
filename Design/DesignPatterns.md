### Design Patterns

### Build-Measure-Learn Design Steps

**Step 1:** Draw a Box

The most important first step that can help any designer or inventor is to draw a mental box around your idea. What is inside the bounds of your idea, and what is outside the bounds? It’s important to not too far down the brainstorm rabbit hole. It’s all too easy for an amateur who doesn’t have a good grasp on
In terms of design, it’s important to make the differentiation between designing and inventing. A designer makes a design of an already made invention. Inventing is much more conceptual.

**Step 2:** Make a Mission and Vision Statement

**Step 3:** R3T3DRT

R3T3DT is an acronym that has been flowing around the engineering community for a long time. It stands for Research, Research, Research, Think, Think, Think, Design, Test.

**Step 4:** Draw a Sketch

Many of the world’s best inventions have all started out as simple sketches.

**Step 5:** Show it to a Friend

Getting instant feedback, even if you don't particularly like it, will dramatically improve your chances of success. There aren't too many cheaper and easier ways to avoid a bad startup than to show your sketched out ideas to your friends and family and try to explain it to them. Most people will like your ideas just because they like you so beware of confirmation bias. Pick a friend who will shoot your ideas down, have them shoot you down, then brew about it till you are pissed off enough you prove your friend wrong.

**Step 6:** Repeat Steps 1 through 4

This is the point where you start saving a lot of time because so far the biggest investment you've put in is thought, pen and paper work, and customer interviews. Repeat this process as many times as needed till you get something you're excited about and proud of.

**Step 7:** Make a Model

* UML
* Business Model Canvas

**Step 8:** Repeat Steps 1 through 6

**Step 9:** Make a Plan

**Step 10:** Identify Phases and Timeline

**Step 11:** Break up first phase into List of Issues

**Step 7:** Tackle Issue by Issue until Phase One Complete

**Step 13:** Interview Customers

**Step 14:** Identify Critical Business Objectives

**Step 15:** Interview Customers

**Step 16:** Scale Product

**Step 17:** Interview Customers

**Step 18:** Hire People Smarter than You

This is the point where all of your models and ideas will go out the window and you will need to hire a lot of people who are smarter than you and can do the things you didn't think of. Your entire goal in life is to get to this point and let the engine you create drive the team where your mission and vision intends.

### Software Design Patterns

Software design patterns come in handy with most STEM-ED disciplines on a daily basis. Software is after all designed, worth a lot of money, and many millions of dollars have been spent developing time optimization and robust system design patterns.

#### Creational Patterns

* Abstract Factory
* Singleton
* Multiton
* Object Pool

#### Structural Patterns

* Facade
* Proxy
* Decorator
* Flyweight

#### Behavioral patterns

* Observer
* Strategy

#### Concurrency Patterns

* Blockchain
* Event-based Asynchronous
* Thread Pool
* Read-write lock
* Global Anti-aliasing

### Symmetry
