### Prototyping

In my college days, I had the opportunity of working as a Student ambassador for my engineering school working with little kids doing activities to get young kids interested in engineering. One of the games that we played was the Marshmallow Tower.

### The Perfection Bug

The Marshmallow Challenge is prototyping exercise where you use spaghetti, marshmallows, tape, and string to build a tower out of marshmallows. The interesting thing about this game is that in studies when kids where pitted against skilled engineers and adults (note there is a difference), the kids usually beat the engineers. This is because the engineers would typically spend too much time trying to make things perfect and proper. This would slow them down and they would often have design blunders. The kids would experiment more and play and it often lean to superior designs. The Marshmallow Challenge is another example of Design Thinking in action.
