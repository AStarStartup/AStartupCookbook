# 3 Documentation

When doing engineering, there are four main types of documents that you will use:

	* Whitepaper
	* Development Log
	* Engineering Requirements Document
	* Engineering Specifications Document
	* Project Timeline
	* Wiki

One of the primary reasons for writing documentation is to be able to collaborate with other people, whether that be a client or a developer. The point is to be able to describe what you’re doing in words, such that another person skilled in the arts can reproduce a behavior using your documentation.

Humans learn much better by physically writing things down. Find research that supports muscle memory learning.
Use Your Log to Keep on Track

One of the biggest benefits for you of keeping up on your handwritten log is that it really does help you keep on track. While you are writing in your log, you take down some notes, and generate some ideas while you are writing, then go directly into your project and do specifically targeted work. Your brain works much more efficiently when you have a plan.

[Neuroscience proof that your brain works better when you have a plan]

## 3.3 Development Logs

Development logs have been a staple of engineering and science projects for centuries. If you study some of the greatest thinkers in history, most have kept logbooks and journals, such as Leonardo da Vinci, Isaac Newton, Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein, Thomas Jefferson, George Lucas, Charles Darwin, Ludwig van Beethoven, Benjamin Franklin, and just about every scientist in the history of science kept log books. Development logs are good for organizing your thoughts. Today, people have begun to shy away from written logs, but there are many reasons why you should keep a written development log.
You have to look at it from the perspective of someone who knows absolutely nothing about the project and your opening up the manual. This person knows absolutely nothing about your project aside from a short verbal description. Most people make the mistake of thinking that just because the person that they are talking to is smart, that they got the intricate details of exactly what you said. It’s pretty common.

The best way to think about what a Development Log is to compare it to taking notes in College where a Technical Reference Document is a writing a paper from information from your notes. A development log is meant to be a chronological log of notes. A Technical Reference Document is not Chronological and is organized into sections based on systems and sub-systems. A development log should be in a bound notebook is such a manner that it be allowed as evidence in a court proceeding. It doesn’t have to look professional. You’re not creating a user’s manual, or even a paper that will be peer reviewed or used as an official company document. What you are creating with a development log is for your own reference, and for any employees that get hired to replace you in the future.

### 3.3.a Log Types

#### Pen and Paper Logs

Pen and paper logs are the preferred method for most because research shows that writing by hand triggers mussel memory that helps you [Insert proof and methods here].

#### Digital Logs

Not everyone likes to keep handwritten log books. Keeping a digital logbook in MarkDown Format or Google Drive or OneDrive can also be just as useful because it is quicker to communicate with others when the data is entered directly into a shared documentation tool. [Insert how to mitigate the digital design log muscle memory problem here.]

### 3.3.b Log Purposes

Just because you said Development Lot on the front of the notebook along with the project name, doesn’t mean that the person who reads it is going to know what it is. Ever good technical document has a brief section in the front for it that describes what the document is. An overview can be as simple as one paragraph.

##### Legal Protection

A well-written development log in a bound notebook can help you out greatly with legal protection. The legal stature for what is allowed as admissible log evidence by a court is similar to the process for patent protection. The logbook needs to be bound such that the pages are not removable

#### Research Purposes

A lot of great inventions happened because of people noticing things when they were working on unrelated projects. By documenting things properly, you can assist in other discoveries along the way.

### 3.3.c Common Log Sections

### 3.3.a. Overview Section
Every document should start with an overview section.

### 3.3.b. Author & Legal Notices
Some random paragraph about why this is completely obvious.

### 3.3.c. Standard Partitioning

Each profession should have its own set of rules that govern what should and should not be in a log to be up to specification. Some standard partitions used across industries are:
* a
* b
* c
* ...

### 3.3.d Log Entries

#### Logging Hours

If you are not currently using any time logging software, it is possible to use headings to store this information for quick retrieval later. All you have to is record your start time, stop time and any noteworthy breaks into the heading in your pre/post-session header. You can also just have a blank section under your header for your break time. This will allow you to quickly copy the time records from a word processor to your spreadsheet software.

Pending your employer needs an official record of your time records, it can be quite a convent to use any standard revision control system to make official records. Simply make your pre-session entry, save the word document, and push the changes to the server. Also, do the same for unpaid breaks, and post-session entries.

Don’t think that you have to be on someone else’s clock to justify doing this. Keeping track of your own hours has also been linked to increasing your own productivity [Note: Insert citation here]. It’s all too easy to let weeks go by without getting the work done that you wanted to do. By keeping good track of your hours will help keep you on your toes because you’ll feel bad whenever you see large gaps in your time records. Before I started keeping tracking of my time, I would even start growing grey hairs without getting anything done. After I started, I haven’t gone more than a few days without getting something done because I feel bad if I see the holes. If you’re not paying attention to the holes, they often go unnoticed.

There is no real set defined format for a development log other then it is chronological. It’s supposed to be off the cut and personal, but there are some common traits to formatting. A development log is very similar to writing notes for a college-level class. Anything that you can think of that would be important for analyzing your or your teams work.

##### Time-On Log

Chronological Formatting is where notes are kept in strict order that they were addressed in the development log. Each day that work is done on the project would be created as the project unfolds.

##### Time-Out Log

When you are done with your work session, you should make a final entry for that work session.
It is useful to make a log when you start your work shift, and describe what you want to accomplish during that work session. This allows you to focus your attention on what needs to be done.
Common Sections

#### Log Format

* Author & Legal Notices
* Overview/Introduction
* Description
* Purpose
* Vision Statement
* End-user Use Examples

#### Log Reviews

Every good development log should have a peer review their logs. We're all trying to get better but we can't without constructive criticism.

## 3.4 Wikis

## 3.4.a Wiki Roles

The first thing that one must understand about a wiki or anything for that matter, is what exactly is a Wiki? A wiki is a web encyclopedia. What is an encyclopedia? It’s a type of quick reference book or software that contains referenced factual knowledge on multiple subjects within it a scope. Which brings us to the more important question: what isn’t a wiki? A Wiki is not a development log, nor is it a technical reference manual, a user’s manual, or a book.

Chances are, no end user will ever read your Wik1. The most important thing about a wiki is that it be quick and easy to understand, and serve a useful function for those who need to use it.

Image this; you are a student and doing some research on a subject. You decide to make an encyclopedia for your initial round of research. You know nothing about the subject other than spotty background information. When you read that article, what type of information are you looking for? Chances are you are initially looking for a 10,000-foot level description that outlines all of the major aspects of what you are research. Chances are that after you get through the 10,000-foot level, you’ll want to go down to the 1,000-foot level and do another round of research about all of the information that you don’t understand. And then go down to 100 feet, to 10 feet, and finally down to 1 foot. Once you have gotten to a discrete unit of reference, you’ve reached the extent of the usefulness of the Wiki because rules applying to discrete systems are different than those of continuous systems.

When does a wiki help? Does a wiki help out a Ph.D. scientist doing their research in a specialized field? Not in the least bit. So then why would you want to use a Wiki? Every last thing that you can do with a Wiki you can do with Microsoft Word or Open Office if you know what you’re doing.

### 3.4.b Group Collaboration

Wikis make it easy for multiple people to edit the Wiki simultaneously. Wiki software also tracks changes made by users and allows you to undo changes and track users.

Wikis aren’t the only method of doing this. Google Docs and Microsoft Skydrive also allow for group collaboration. There are many drawbacks to using these systems over a Wiki which all start to rear their ugly heads as the amount of information in the document grows. Searching through word documents is limited and doesn’t allow users to take advantage of metadata. When you search through a Wiki, you can use more ad. Also, when you look at information in a document, it does not isolate the information from the rest of the text as online search results do. This can be confusing to people.

## 3.4.c Types of Wikis

Not every Wiki has to be used for technical information.

#### Scratchpad Wiki

One of the benefits of using a Wiki is that it is really easy to create new pages.

#### Quickstart Wiki

This type of wiki describes the quickstart setup process that quickly gets you started with the product. This wiki page doesn't have to be very long. Just walk the user through the setup process from the very begging to the point where most users will be able to then use the product.

#### Script Wiki

The standard style to walk users through console commands without thinking is: write me!

### 3.4.d Wiki Authoring Styles

There are three main types of orders to develop a wik1. A preemptive wiki, a concurrent authored wiki, and post authored wiki.

#### Preemptive Wiki

This is where the Wiki is written before the concurrent engineering project starts.

##### Benefits

* Can speed up development when part of the team is inexperienced.
* Can facilitate better project planning up front.

##### Drawbacks

* Easy to waste time inventing and not testing.

#### Concurrent Authored Wiki

A concurrent authored wiki is when the Wiki is written concurrently as the project happens.

##### Drawbacks

* This can waste a bunch of time.

### 3.4.e Tracking User Requirements

It’s all too easy for someone two is skilled in the arts to totally brush over things that trip other people up. Sometimes we just think that it’s too basic to bother addressing. The whole purpose of the Wiki is to the server as a quick reference for someone to get brought up to speed. Hands down the best way of doing this are with the Agile process. You really can’t expect to email a team member and ask them what questions they have about the Wik1. Chances are, there are so many problems they won’t know where to start and you won’t get the feedback you want. You really need to go over Wiki pages in person with someone who doesn’t know everything you know.

#### Verification Needs

The first question that you need to ask is whether it even matters if it meets the user’s needs. Is it even important? Again a wiki is a quick reference.

## 3.4.f Malicious Changes

Sometimes, people like to break things and mess with people. Don’t think that your project is immune from stupid people. Anytime you open up your files to another person, you run the risk of that person maliciously harming your files. Sometimes it’s your best friend trying to mess with you, sometimes it’s a random internet vandal, and sometimes it’s a disgruntled soon to be former team member hell bent on destroying your project because you didn’t like their idea. In any situation, you need to be able to monitor users for this type of behavior and reverse any damage they have done.

## 3.5 Technical Writing

## 3.5.a Styles & Formats

One of the jobs of a technical writer is to convey technical data in the most intuitive way possible. It is important that a user to be able to understand the information in as little amount of time as possible.

#### Headings

Making proper use of headings can save you and your team a lot of time and increase productivity. You should think off headings as indentation levels on a bulleted list.

```
    1. Heading 1
        a. Heading 2
        b. Another Heading 2
            1. Heading 3
            2. Another Heading 3
                1. Heading 4
            3. Even more 3 Headings
    2. Another Heading 1
    3. …
```

Most people put off using headers until the end of their document in order to create the Table of Content (TOC) unless they absolutely have to, thinking that the TOC is only useful for the end-user of the document. This is not true. Proper use of the headings from the beginning can also be of great use to the author.

Tables of Content allow the user to jump around their document using the Navigation Pane. Modern word processing software automatically hyperlinks all heading metadata The Navigation Pane is not visible by default in Word, but can be viewed by clicking on the View Tab and clicking the checkbox that says “Navigation Pane”.

### 3.5.b Styles

Any word processing document, PDF, or website can search the same way by a search engine. Part of effective writing is helping your audience effectively find the information they seek through proper use of metadata. It’s not too hard to do, as long as you know the basics of how search engines parse documents.
Word Processing software makes this job much easier for writers through the use of styles. When a search engine parses a document,

[Insert info about how search engines parse documents]

An easy way to assist your viewers to find the content they need is to put a list of relevant keywords that a user would search for, in a comma-separated list at either the very end of the document or on one of the first handful of pages.

##### Indexing Key Words

## 3.5.c Mathematical Equations

This section goes over the different ways of getting math equations into the computer.

#### Word Processing Equations Editors

#### LaTeX

LaTex is the most popular math scripting language in use today. It’s a little bit like

#### MathJax

#### Online Tools

If you simply type in equation editor into Google, it will pop up a large query of websites where you can input math formulas. Some will output an image that you can either download or copy and paste into a document. Others will output LaTeX code.

If you are using LaTeX in a word processing document, you can insert the LaTex code as a comment through the following method that I will write about later.

[Insert how to store LaTeX code in word documents and spreadsheets.]
