## Engineering Thought Process

This chapter is all about learning to think like an engineer. In many ways, an engineer is an inventor. The definition of an invention according to Google 2014 is “the action of inventing something, typically a process or device.” An invention is only an invention the first time it is created. After that, it is no longer new and is a product.
