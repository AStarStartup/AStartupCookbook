## Common Acronyms

### DRY

The Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle comes from software engineering and the purpose is that when you repeat the same source code, humans will almost indefinitely introduce bugs. For this reason it is best to write code only once and use the pre-written and tested code whenever possible. This reduces the cost of development and provides a more reliable product.

### KISS

The Keep it short and simple (KISS) principle is a variation of Occam's razor.

### R4

Rapidly Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle.
